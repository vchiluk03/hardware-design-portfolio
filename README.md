## Technical Competencies

- **HDL & Verification:** SystemVerilog, Verilog, UVM-style testbenches, assertions, scoreboards, constraints and directed/random testing.
- **Protocols:** I²C, Wishbone, and AMBA protocols (APB/AHB/AXI).
- **Architecture:** Cache simulation, branch prediction, and out-of-order pipeline modeling.
- **Tools:** Questa/ModelSim, Makefile automation, and Synopsys Design Compiler.
- **Programming:** C++ and Python.

## Repository Content Policy

To uphold academic integrity and responsible sharing practices:

- **Included:** Documentation, reports, figures, waveform snapshots, setup notes, and non-sensitive artifacts.
- **Restricted:** Original graded source files and selected scripts are not publicly exposed in raw form.

This portfolio is structured for professional technical review while respecting coursework and sharing constraints.

## Code Access for Recruiting / Interviews

If your evaluation requires code-level review, submit a request using:

**Code Access Request Form**  
https://github.com/vchiluk03/hardware-design-portfolio/issues/new?template=code_access_request.yml&title=Code%20Access%20Request

### Review Process

1. Submit the request with role/company context.
2. Requests are reviewed manually.
3. Approved access is provided in a **read-only format** (for example: PDF snapshot or time-limited archive).

> Direct collaborator access to private repositories is not granted.
