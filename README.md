# Professional Projects Showcase

Portfolio of **ASIC Design, Verification, and Microarchitecture** projects by *Vishnuvardhan Chilukoti*.

This repository contains project summaries, reports, figures, and non-code artifacts from my academic projects.

To comply with academic integrity and responsible sharing practices, source code and scripts are not published publicly here.

## Code Access Requests

If code review is needed for recruiting/interviews, submit a request here:

https://github.com/<your-username>/<public-repo>/issues/new?title=Code%20Access%20Request

I review requests and share code in a **read-only format** (for example, PDF snapshot or time-limited archive). I do not grant direct collaborator access to the private repository.

## About This Portfolio

- Focus areas: UVM/SystemVerilog verification, digital design, and computer architecture simulations.
- Includes: project reports, architecture notes, waveforms, and results.
- Excludes: original source files and scripts (kept private).
